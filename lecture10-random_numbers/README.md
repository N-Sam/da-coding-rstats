# Lecture 10: Random Numbers and Random Sampling in R
*Coding course to complete Data Analysis in R*

This lecture introduces students to how to generate random numbers and deal with random sampling in R.

It uses `sp500` data from the case study [CH05A](https://gabors-data-analysis.com/casestudies/#ch05a-what-likelihood-of-loss-to-expect-on-a-stock-portfolio) to show random sampling.


## Learning outcomes
After successfully live-coding the material (see: [`random_numbers.md`](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/blob/main/lecture10-random_numbers/random_numbers.md)), students will have knowledge on

- When and why random numbers are used in R
- Different `distributions` and their properties available in R
  - Specifically get familiar with `runif` and `rnorm`
- How to control for randomness via `set.seed`
- How the number of observations generated by `rnorm` is associated with the theoretical normal distribution
- How random sampling works:
  - `sample_n` function
  - other alternatives such as `slice_sample`, `sample` and `sample.int`    

## Lecture Time

Ideal overall time: **10-20 mins**.

This is a relatively short lecture with few coding, but many background knowledge is needed on how random number generation works.

## Homework

*Type*: quick practice, approx 15 mins, together with [lecture08-conditionals](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/edit/main/lecture08-conditionals), [lecture09-loops](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/edit/main/lecture09-loops), and [lecture11-functions](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/edit/main/lecture11-functions)

## Further material

  - Jae Yeon Kim: R Fundamentals for Public Policy, Course material, [Lecture 10](https://github.com/KDIS-DSPPM/r-fundamentals/blob/main/lecture_notes/10_functional_programming.Rmd) touches the topic, but not too deeply.


## File structure
  
  - [`random_numbers.md`](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/blob/main/lecture10-random_numbers/random_numbers.md) provides material for the live coding session with explanations.
  - [`random_numbers.Rmd`](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/blob/main/lecture10-random_numbers/random_numbers.Rmd) is the generating Rmarkdown file for `random_numbers.md`
  - **[`random_numbers.R`](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/blob/main/lecture10-random_numbers/random_numbers.R)** is a possible realization of the live coding session
