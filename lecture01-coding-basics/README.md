# Lecture 01: Coding basics

This is the first coding lecture, which introduces students to coding in R.
It is a **live coding class**, where the teaching material is detailed in [`coding_basics.md`](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/blob/main/lecture01-coding-basics/coding_basics.md).


## Learning outcomes
After successfully live-coding the material ([`coding_basics.md`](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/blob/main/lecture01-coding-basics/coding_basics.md)), students will have knowledge on

- What is RStudio.
- How to run a command via console.
- What is a script and how to create one.
   - Difference between a script and a project. 
- What are the basics of coding:
  - how to name your variables, how to use comments, and format your code
  - what is an R-object and what operations can one do with it (numeric, logical, characters, and factors)
  - what is a built-in function and how does it work
  - how to decide the type of R-objects via functions
  - how to create a vector, what are the vector operations and how to get elements of it via indexing.
  - what are the special variables/values/issues (empty variable, NA, Inf, precision)
  - what are the different variable types
  - create different vectors
  - create lists and indexing with lists

## Datasets used

- No dataset is used in this lecture

## Lecture Time

Ideal overall time: **100 mins**.

This lecture time is one of the hardest to predict, as it solely depends on the background of the students. This is an introductory class showing how coding works in general. Always aim for students with the least knowledge. Note, however, that there are extra 'good-to-know' parts that can be skipped.

This lecture time assumes that R and RStudion already work on their laptops.

## Homework

*Type*: quick practice, approx 15 mins, 7+1 lines of code. See [`assignment_1.R`](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/blob/main/lecture01-coding-basics/assignment_1.R).

## Further material

  - Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund R for Data Science [Chapter 4](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-basics.html) provide some basic principles and using the console. [Chapter 6](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-scripts.html) deals with scripts and some error handling.[Chapter 8](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html) shows how to work with projects, along with useful setup options and working directory settings. [Chapter 20](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/vectors.html) provides a similar but more detailed discussion.
  - Kieran H. (2019): Data Visualization [Chapter 2.2-2.3](https://socviz.co/gettingstarted.html#use-r-with-rstudio) introduces window structure in RStudio pretty well (Chapter 2.2) and basic syntax, objects, libraries (Chapter 2.3)
  - Jae Yeon Kim: R Fundamentals for Public Policy, Course material, [Lecture 02](https://github.com/KDIS-DSPPM/r-fundamentals/blob/main/lecture_notes/02_code_style.Rmd) provides useful guidelines on how to write and format codes. [Lecture 03](https://github.com/KDIS-DSPPM/r-fundamentals/blob/main/lecture_notes/03_1d_data.Rmd) provides some additional exercises and insights into R-objects, variable types, and some basic functions.


## File structure
  
  - [`coding_basics.md`](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/blob/main/lecture01-coding-basics/coding_basics.md) provides material for the live coding session with explanations.
  - [`coding_basics.Rmd`](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/blob/main/lecture01-coding-basics/coding_basics.Rmd) is the generating Rmarkdown file for [`coding_basics.md`]((https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/blob/main/lecture01-coding-basics/coding_basics.md))
  - [**`first_script.R`**](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/blob/main/lecture01-coding-basics/first_script.R) is a possible realization of the live coding session
  - [`assignment_1.R`](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/blob/main/lecture01-coding-basics/assignment_1.R) is the assignment after the first lecture.
