# Lecture 09: Programming loops in R
*Coding course to complete Data Analysis in R*

This lecture introduces students to imperative programming with `for` and `while` loops. 


## Learning outcomes
After successfully live-coding the material (see: [`loops.md`](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/blob/main/lecture09-loops/loops.md)), students will have knowledge on

- What is imperative programming and what is functional programming for iterations
- What is a for loop
  - what are the possible inputs for an iteration vector
  - how to measure CPU time
  - what are the possible issues with the for-loop
- What is a while loop
  - what are the possible drawbacks of a while loop
  - how to use a for loop instead
  - `break` command     

## Lecture Time

Ideal overall time: **10-20 mins**.

This is a relatively short lecture, and it can be even shorter if measuring CPU time is neglected.

## Homework

*Type*: quick practice, approx 15 mins, together with [lecture08-conditionals](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/edit/main/lecture08-conditionals), [lecture10-random_numbers](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/edit/main/lecture10-random_numbers), and [lecture11-functions](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/edit/main/lecture11-functions).

## Further material

  - Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund R for Data Science [Chapter 21](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html) provide further material on iterations, both imperative and functional programming.
  - Jae Yeon Kim: R Fundamentals for Public Policy, Course material, [Lecture 10](https://github.com/KDIS-DSPPM/r-fundamentals/blob/main/lecture_notes/10_functional_programming.Rmd) provides useful guidelines on iterations along with other programming skills.


## File structure
  
  - [`loops.md`](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/blob/main/lecture09-loops/loops.md) provides material for the live coding session with explanations.
  - [`loops.Rmd`](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/blob/main/lecture09-loops/loops.Rmd) is the generating Rmarkdown file for `loops.md`
  - **[`loops.R`](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/blob/main/lecture09-loops/loops.R)** is a possible realization of the live coding session
