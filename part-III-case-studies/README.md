# Coding material in R for Part III: Prediction

This sub-folder contains modified codes from [Gabor's official case study repo](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da_case_studies) to tailor them into the needs of the seminars for Part III: prediction.

It covers different machine learning based methods such as

  - cross validation for model selection
  - LASSO, RIDGE and Elastic Net
  - Regression Trees with CART algorithm
  - Random Forest and Boosting

to predict
  
  - cross-sectional data with continuous outcome
  - cross-sectional data with binary outcome: probabilities and classification.

Part III also covers time-series data and offers cross-validation techniques for simple time series, ARIMA and VAR models with an outlook of using the `prophet` package.

Our general approach is to use `caret` as an umbrella package and then supply it with different packages containing different ML tools.

## Seminars

There are 7 seminars connecting to Part III, however usually only 6 classes, as the last two seminars are coveres in one class. The usual way how this material is organized is the following:

| Class | Seminar | Learning outcome | Case-study | Dataset |
| ----- | ------- | ---------------- | ---------- | ------- |
