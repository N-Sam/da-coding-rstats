# Lecture 00: Getting started with R
*Coding course to complete Data Analysis in R*

This is the first coding lecture, which introduces students to R and RStudio and shows how it works in general.
It is a **live coding class**, that introduces the basics. Teaching material is detailed in [`getting_started.md`](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/blob/main/lecture00-intro/getting_started.md).


## Learning outcomes
After successfully live-coding the material (see: [`getting_started.md`](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/blob/main/lecture00-intro/getting_started.md)), students will have knowledge on

- How RStudio works and which window is which.
- How to run a command via console.
- What is a script.

## Lecture Time

Ideal overall time: **20 mins**.

This lecture time assumes that R and RStudion already work on their laptops.

## Homework

No homework, apart from fixing possible issues with R, RStudio and compiling an .Rmd in html and in pdf.

## Further material

  - Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund R for Data Science [Chapter 20](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/vectors.html) provide a similar but more detailed discussion.
  - Kieran H. (2019): Data Visualization [Chapter 2.2-2.3](https://socviz.co/gettingstarted.html#use-r-with-rstudio) introduces window structure in RStudio pretty well (Chapter 2.2) and basic syntax, objects, libraries (Chapter 2.3)
  - Jae Yeon Kim: R Fundamentals for Public Policy, Course material, [Lecture 02](https://github.com/KDIS-DSPPM/r-fundamentals/blob/main/lecture_notes/02_code_style.Rmd) provides useful guidelines on how to write and format codes.


## File structure
  
  - [`getting_started.md`](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/blob/main/lecture00-intro/getting_started.md) provides material for the live coding session with explanations.
  - [`getting_started.Rmd`](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/blob/main/lecture00-intro/getting_started.Rmd) is the generating Rmarkdown file for `getting_started.md`
  - [`intro_to_R.R`](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/blob/main/lecture01-intro/intro_to_R.R) includes codes to introduce scripts, install `tidyverse`, and show how cool R is.
  - [`test_Rmarkdown.Rmd`](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/blob/main/lecture01-intro/test_Rmarkdown.Rmd) is a test file to reveal possible issues with knitting a Rmarkdown document. During the course students needs to be able to compile their work into pdf and/or html. This is a test, which is super important to do as quickly as possible, while some fixes takes a while...
