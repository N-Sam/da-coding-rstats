# Lecture 02: Tibbles
*Coding course to complete Data Analysis in R*

This lecture introduces `tibble`s as Data variable in `tidyverse`. It uses pre-written codes with tasks during the class.


## Learning outcomes
After successfully completing codes in *raw_codes* you should be able:

[`intro_to_tibbles.R`](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/blob/main/lecture02-tibbles/raw_codes/intro_to_tibbles.R)
  - understand what is a 'Data' variable, why to use tibble and how it relates to `data_frame` and `data.frame`
  - How to do indexing with a tibble
    - indexing with integer numbers
    - indexing with logicals
    - when to use which and what are the connections
  - How to use simple functions with tibbles
  - How to:
    - reset a cell's value in a tibble
    - add or remove a column (or variable)
    - add or remove a row (or an observation)
  - Merging - how to merge two tibbles, if:
    - new rows/observations are in the new tibble
    - new columns/variables are in the new tibble  
    - what is long and wide format and how to convert one to another      

## Lecture Time

Ideal overall time: **40 mins**.

Showing [`intro_to_tibbles.R`](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/blob/main/lecture02-tibbles/raw_codes/intro_to_tibbles.R) takes around *15-20 minutes*, while doing the tasks would take the rest.
 

## Homework

*Type*: quick practice, approx 15 mins

## Further material

  - Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund R for Data Science: [Chapter 12](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html) introduces to tidy approach and works with tibble. [Chapter 13](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html) provide a detailed discussion on merging.
  - Jae Yeon Kim: R Fundamentals for Public Policy, Course material, [Lecture 05]((https://github.com/KDIS-DSPPM/r-fundamentals/blob/main/lecture_notes/05_tidy_data.Rmd) provides useful further guidelines on tidy approach and merging.


## Folder structure
  
  - [raw_codes](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/blob/main/lecture02-tibbles/raw_codes) includes one code, which is ready to use during the course but requires some live coding in class.
    - [`intro_to_tibbles.R`](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/blob/main/lecture02-tibbles/raw_codes/intro_to_tibbles.R)
  - [complete_codes](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/blob/main/lecture02-tibbles/complete_codes) includes one code with solutions for
    - [`intro_to_tibbles.R`](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/blob/main/lecture02-tibbles/raw_codes/intro_to_tibbles.R) as - [`intro_to_tibbles_fin.R`](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/blob/main/lecture02-tibbles/complete_codes/intro_to_tibbles_fin.R)
