## Overview

The course serves as an introduction to the R programming language and software environment for data exploration, data munging, data visualization, reporting, and modeling. 

Lectures 1 to 11 complements [Part I: Data Exploration (Chapter 1-6)](https://gabors-data-analysis.com/chapters/#part-i-data-exploration) focuses on basic programming principles, data structures, data cleaning and data exploration with descriptives and graphs, and simple hypothesis testing. This is an intro package to learning R and using it for exploration and some basic analysis. 

Lecture 12 to 19 complements [PART II: Regression Analysis (Chapter 7-12)](https://gabors-data-analysis.com/chapters/#part-ii-regression-analysis) focuses on statistical methods such as nonparametric regression, single and multiple linear cross-sections, binary models and simple time-series analysis while adding more advanced toolkit for visualization and reporting. This is a regression focused package with advnaced features for analysis including markdown.

## Teaching philosophy

We believe students will learn using R by writing scripts and solving problems on their own. We provide and show them good practices on how to carry out such tasks, but extensive usage is needed.

This is not a hardcore coding course, but a course to supplement data analysis. The material focuses on specific issues in this topic and balances between higher levels of coding such as `tidyverse` -- which is more intuitive, easier to learn, but less flexible -- and lower levels in form of basic coding principles -- which allows greater complexity, deeper understanding, but requires much more practice and has a steeper learning curve. 

The material structure reflects these principles. The majority of the lecturers have pre-written codes which include in-class tasks to practice and face problems along with regular homework. This enables the instructor to show a greater variety of codes, good examples for coding, and way more commands and functions than live coding while providing room for practicing. For this type of lecture, homework is essential, as it helps students to deepen their coding skills. There are also few live-coding lectures, which require flexibility and more preparation from the teacher (material provides detailed instructions). These lectures are focusing on basic coding principles such as the introduction to coding, functions, loops, conditionals, etc., and show students possible paths to hardcore coding, while showing alternative methods as well.

It is always a good question if solutions for the tasks or homework should be made available for students. We believe show students the in-class solution is beneficial and does not distort motivation as slower learners may want to revise and compare the true solution to their own. Hence, for each lecture, we provide the solutions for these tasks. However, this is not the case for the homework. We found that showing solutions to the students rather depresses their motivation and creativity, therefore there are no solutions for the homework. (It is important that there are (infinitely) many good solutions for an HW, thus we usually encourage students to try out different paths as well.)


## How to use

This course material may be used as a basis for a course on learning coding with R for the purpose of analyzing data. It is developed to be taught simultaneously with the textbook but may be used independently. It is rather comprehensive and thus, may be used without any textbook to prepare. 

We have not invented the coding wheel. Instead tried to adopt best practices and combine them with real-life case studies from the textbook.

There are no slides, but codes are commented heavily thus it should be easy to follow. In some cases, it is beneficial to read the related case study and/or the chapter to fully appreciate the codes and comments, but not necessary. 

Within each lecture, there is an estimated time that the lecture would need with suggestions on how to shorten the lecture if it would be too long. The lectures are -- in purpose -- contain more material than what a classical 100-mins class per week for 12 weeks would take. It is always easier to cut material than add to it and the taste of each instructor and/or class may differ. We highly encourage you to use each lecture as a starting point and modify it accordingly. Later, we propose an example for this 100-mins class per week for a semester (12 weeks).

*case study was the base for the material, but coding material is modified

**only used in homework


### Folder structure within lectures

Within each lecture there is the following folder structure:
  - `raw_codes`: includes codes, which are ready to use during the course but require some live coding in class.
  - `complete_codes`: includes codes with suggested solutions to codes in `raw_codes`
  - `data`: in some cases, there is a data folder, which includes data files (typically in '.csv'). I have found it crucial during live-coding classes to make sure everybody has the same data.
  - if there are no folders then:
    - lecture has a notebook format, which implies a complete live-coding class (mostly introduction or technical ''hard-core coding'' lectures)
    - lecture has a complete R-script. In this case, the lecturer should pay attention to the interpretation of the material itself rather than to coding. Typically this is for more advanced case studies (chapters 13-18), where there is no new coding technique, but interpreting the results might be challenging.

## Learning outcomes and relation to the book

Probably, the largest difference compared to the book is that data handling is the most challenging and most time-consuming part of coding, while it is a relatively little (but as important!) part of the book. It is always a challenge to keep up with the material if the two courses (Data Analysis and Coding) are running parallel. Experience shows that [lecture05-data-exploration](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/tree/main/lecture05-data-exploration) in this course is the first truly common point with the book and [lecture06-rmarkdown101](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/tree/main/lecture06-rmarkdown101) enables students to submit data analysis material via pdf or HTML. This coding material was developed such that it catches up with the book as quickly as possible, showing truly essential tools to do data handling with the data in an easy way. The result is that after 6 lectures from both courses (teaching Part I. of the book) there is room for common assignment in the form of a descriptive analysis: e.g. carry out a data-collection exercise, clean the data and do exploratory analysis. The 'cost' is that apart from some references or homework there is no true connection between the two courses before [lecture05-data-exploration](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/tree/main/lecture05-data-exploration) in coding and the data handling skills can be improved even more. Therefore do not expect students to be able to solve (all) of the data exercises from the book (however, there were some positive surprises during the years).

In contrast, Part II in the book deals with regressions of various forms. This is fairly simple from the coding perspective, which allows the lecturer to deepen students' knowledge of 

1. basic coding principles;
2. add further data handling practices to students' toolkit, and 
3. provide more skills on Rmarkdown, while following the material of the book. 
 
If material is properly taught -- for Part III of the book -- there is no need for an extra coding course, but a simple seminar type of supplement, which put emphasis on *interpretation* and *practice* of machine learning methods. In principle after these materials, students should be able to code by themself and understand and work with case study materials related to Part IV.

## Example course

As an example for a coding course, which takes one 100-mins class per week for a semester (12 weeks), we have taught the followings:

|   Class  | Lecture(s) | Comments |
| -------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Class 01 | [lecture00-intro](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/tree/main/lecture00-intro), [lecture01-coding-basics](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/tree/main/lecture01-coding-basics) | Installation of R, RStudio, and `tidyverse` package along with knitting an RMarkdown is asked to be done before the class. From coding basics some materials (e.g. numeric vs integer vs double, or indexing or lists) are left out if I run out of time. |
| Class 02 | [lecture02-data-imp-n-exp](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/tree/main/lecture02-data-imp-n-exp), [lecture03-tibbles](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/tree/main/lecture03-tibbles) | Sometimes [lecture03-tibbles](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/tree/main/lecture03-tibbles) finished on next class. |
| Class 03 | [lecture04-data-munging](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/tree/main/lecture04-data-munging), start: [lecture05-data-exploration](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/tree/main/lecture05-data-exploration)  | Ask about RMarkdown knitting. |
| Class 04 | Finish: [lecture05-data-exploration](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/tree/main/lecture05-data-exploration), [lecture06-rmarkdown101](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/tree/main/lecture06-rmarkdown101)| At this point, should assess students that they understand the basics of coding and make sure nobody is struggling. From this class they should be able to prepare for submitting a project for 6th week's assessment, which should be 2 weeks from this point. |
| Class 05 | [lecture07-ggplot-indepth](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/tree/main/lecture07-ggplot-indepth), [lecture08-conditionals](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/tree/main/lecture08-conditionals) | This class provides some room for repetition or clarifying concepts.
| Class 06 | [lecture09-loops](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/tree/main/lecture09-loops), [lecture10-random-numbers](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/tree/main/lecture10-random-numbers) and [lecture11-functions](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/tree/main/lecture11-functions) | Should be a more relaxed class as during these days there are many (other) assessment for student and concentrate more on the joy of programming. Many students may already know this material, try to come up with some entertaining tasks for them as well. |
| Class 07 | [lecture12-intro-to-regression](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/tree/main/lecture12-intro-to-regression), [lecture13-feature-engineering](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/tree/main/lecture13-feature-engineering) | Feature engineering is new material, but fits here quite well. Class 07 should be **after** first class from Part II, which discusses Chapter 7. |
| Class 08 | [lecture14-simple-regression](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/tree/main/lecture14-simple-regression) | Great opportunity for in-class (team) work for students with live coding. |
| Class 09 | [lecture15-advanced-linear-regression](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/tree/main/lecture15-advanced-linear-regression) | Make sure students covered Chapter 10 from the book. If not, spatial data visualization is a great substitute here. |
| Class 10 | [lecture16-binary-models](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/tree/main/lecture16-binary-models) | In some cases this material is covered as a seminar from the course that discusses Part II. This provides an opportunity to fill any gaps or make class 12 not so dense, by jumping to the next class's material. |
| Class 11 | [lecture17-dates-n-times](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/tree/main/lecture17-dates-n-times), [lecture18-timeseries-regression](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/tree/main/lecture18-timeseries-regression) | If short in time, skip [lecture17-dates-n-times](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/tree/main/lecture17-dates-n-times) |
| Class 12 | [lecture19-advaced-rmarkdown](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/tree/main/lecture19-advaced-rmarkdown), [lecture20-basic-spatial-vizz](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/tree/main/lecture20-basic-spatial-vizz) | Two paths: discuss [lecture19-advaced-rmarkdown](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/tree/main/lecture19-advaced-rmarkdown) in detail with the whys as well, but then there is no time for [lecture20-basic-spatial-vizz](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/tree/main/lecture20-basic-spatial-vizz). Or stick with the technical details in both lectures, which allows higher probability to finish. |
| Class * | [lecture20-basic-spatial-vizz](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/tree/main/lecture20-basic-spatial-vizz) | This lecture seldomly fits into the timeframe of the class, especially if this coding class runs along with theory classes for Part I and II and serves as a supplement both in coding and understanding the material. However, if there is a mismatch, this class can be flexibly used as a substitute (e.g. theory class is lagging behind) |
