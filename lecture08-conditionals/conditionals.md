Conditional Programming in R
================
Agoston Reguly

## What are conditional statements

Conditionals are expressions that perform different computations or
actions depending on whether a predefined logical expression (aka
boolean) condition is `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

### The `if` statement

The `if` statement takes a condition and if the condition evaluates to
`TRUE` the associated R code is executed.

Pseudo-code:

``` r
if (condition) {
  command
}
```

The condition to check appears inside parentheses, while the R code that
has to be executed if the condition is TRUE, follows in curly brackets.

Lets take a simple example:

``` r
x <- 5
if ( x == 5){
  print( 'x is equal to 5')
}
```

    ## [1] "x is equal to 5"

### Using `else` to complement conditional

The `else` statement complements the `if` condition: if the condition
evaluates to `FALSE` with the `else` statement you can specify what
alternative command should R execute.

Pseudo-code:

``` r
if (condition) {
  command
} else{
  do_something_else
}
```

To continue our example Lets take a simple example:

``` r
x2 <- 4
if ( x2 == 5){
  print( 'x2 is equal to 5')
} else{
  print( 'x2 is not equal to 5')
}
```

    ## [1] "x2 is not equal to 5"

### Multiple `if` and `else` statements:

It is possible to make more elaborate conditional execution with
multiple `if` and `else` statements:

Pseudo-code:

``` r
if ( condition_1 ){
  command_1
} else if ( condition_2 ){
  command_2
} else if ( condition_3 ){
  command_3
} else if( ... ){
  ...
} else{
  if_none_of_conditions_are_true_do_this
}
```

and to show a real example:

``` r
x <- -5
if ( x > 0 ){
  print( "positive number")
} else if( x == 0 ){
  print( "zero value")
} else{
  print('negative number')
}
```

    ## [1] "negative number"

## Multiple conditions

From the logic of `if` and `else` statements it follows that multiple
conditions are possible when creating a conditional execution. The only
challenge is that the end result should be one logical value.

### Multiple logical statements

I call multiple logical statements the case when there are multiple
single-valued variables evaluated in the condition. In this case always
use double logical operators such as `&&` or `||`, which ensures that
the end result is one logical value. However, be careful, if you supply
a vector instead of a single-valued variable, you may end up with
unintended results.

``` r
y <- 10
if ( x > 0 && y > 0 ){
  print("x and y are positive numbers")
} else{
  print("one of y or x is non-positive")
}
```

    ## [1] "one of y or x is non-positive"

### Conditional with one vector

Another possibility is when one works with vectors (or matrices), which
does not result in one logical, but rather in a vector (or matrix) of
logical. Let us consider the following simple example. Before we use
them in an `if-else` statement, let us do some logical operations:

``` r
v <- c( 0 , 1 , 10 )
```

First, let check if elements of v larger than 0

``` r
v > 0
```

    ## [1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE

which results in a vector. To suppress this into one logical outcome, we
need to decide what we want:

-   if any element is larger than zero -> use `any()`
-   if all elements are larger than zero -> use `all()`

Let us say we want any elements to be larger than zero, thus:

``` r
if ( any( v > 0 ) ){
  print('We have at least one element in v, which is larger than zero!')
} else {
  print('All elements in v, are smaller than zero!')
}
```

    ## [1] "We have at least one element in v, which is larger than zero!"

### Conditional with two or more vector

If we have more than one vector, conditionals can be tricky and the
programmer must be careful at which level are the logical operations.
Let us create another vector `q`.

``` r
q <- c( 2 , 0 , 8 )
```

Let us check again if elements are larger than zero or not. We have
again two cases under the assumption `v` and `q` have the same elements.

-   one of the elements in `v` and `q` â€“ **evaluated pairwise** - is
    larger than zero:

``` r
v | q > 0
```

    ## [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE

-   both elements in `v` and `q` - **evaluated pairwise** is larger than
    zero:

``` r
v & q > 0
```

    ## [1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE

At this point we can check the differences between single-operators and
double-operators

``` r
v | q > 0
```

    ## [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE

``` r
v || q > 0
```

    ## [1] TRUE

Using double-operators will imply `any()` for `||` and `all()` for `&&`:

``` r
( v || q > 0 ) == any( v | q > 0 )
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
( v && q > 0 ) == all( v & q > 0 )
```

    ## [1] TRUE

therefore one needs to be careful, when using these operators with
vectors, as the results can be different if mixing these up, e.g.

``` r
v && q > 0
```

    ## [1] FALSE

``` r
any( v & q > 0 )
```

    ## [1] TRUE

## Extra material

In the following, we cover some non-essential, but good-to-know
materials related to conditionals.

### Spacing and formatting

It is possible to write short `if-else` statements in one line:

``` r
if ( x > 5 ){ print(' x > 5') } else { print('x <= 5' ) }
```

    ## [1] "x <= 5"

However, it is not recommended as it makes reading the code much harder.

### The `ifelse()` function

There is a built-in `ifelse(condition,if_true,if_false)` function, which
is a compact form of `if-else` statements. Again, this is a bit harder
to read as the convention for `if-else` statements in coding is to have
them in separate lines:

``` r
ifelse( x > 5 , print( 'x>5' ) , print( 'x<=5' ) )
```

    ## [1] "x<=5"

    ## [1] "x<=5"

### The `xor` operator

There is another logical operator `xor`, which takes two logical
value/vectors as inputs. `xor` will result in `TRUE` if, during the
element-by-element comparison, the logical expressions are different in
the vectors and `FALSE` if they are the same. E.g.

``` r
xor(c(T,F,F,T),c(T,T,F,F))
```

    ## [1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE

### `switch` statement

The `switch` statement is a handy tool if you have multiple possible
scenarios and you do not want to use logicals, but strings. Let us check
the following toy-example:

``` r
type <- 'apple'
switch(type,
       apple = 'I love apple!',
       banana = 'I love banana!',
       orange = 'I love orange!',
       error("type must be either \"apple\",\"banana\", or \"orange\"")
       )
```

    ## [1] "I love apple!"

The last part of this expression `error()` is called error handling,
which we will discuss later.
