# Lecture 01: Getting started with R
*Coding course to complete Data Analysis in R*

This is the first coding lecture, which introduces students to R and RStudio and shows how it works in general.
It is a *live coding class*, that introduces the basics. Teaching material is detailed in [`getting_started.md`](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/blob/main/lecture01-intro/getting_started.md).


## Learning outcomes
After successfully live-coding the material (see: [`getting_started.md`](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/blob/main/lecture01-intro/getting_started.md)), students will have knowledge on

- How RStudio works and which window is which.
- How to run a command via console.
- What is a script and how to create one.
- What is the basics of coding:
  - how to name your variables, how to use comments, and format your code
  - what is an R-object and what operations can do with it (numeric, logical, characters, and factors)
  - what is a function and how does it work
  - how to decide the type of R-objects via functions
  - how to create a vector, what are the vector operations and how to get elements of it via indexing.
  - what are the special variables/values/issue (empty variable, NA, Inf, precision)
  - what are the different variable types
  - create different vectors
  - create lists and indexing with lists

## Lecture Time

Ideal overall time: **100 mins**.

This is one of the hardest to predict as it solely depends on the background of the students. This is an introductory class showing how coding works in general. Always aim to the students with the least knowledge. Note however there are some extra good-to-know parts in this lecture that can be skipped.

This lecture time assumes that R and RStudion already work on their laptops.

## Homework

*Type*: quick practice, approx 15 mins, 7+1 lines of code. See [`assignment_1.R`]()

## Further material

  - Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund R for Data Science [Chapter 20](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/vectors.html) provide a similar but more detailed discussion.
  - Kieran H. (2019): Data Visualization [Chapter 2.2-2.3](https://socviz.co/gettingstarted.html#use-r-with-rstudio) introduces window structure in RStudio pretty well (Chapter 2.2) and basic syntax, objects, libraries (Chapter 2.3)
  - Jae Yeon Kim: R Fundamentals for Public Policy, Course material, [Lecture 02](https://github.com/KDIS-DSPPM/r-fundamentals/blob/main/lecture_notes/02_code_style.Rmd) provides useful guidelines on how to write and format codes.


## File structure
  
  - [`getting_started.md`](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/blob/main/lecture01-intro/getting_started.md) provides material for the live coding session with explanations.
  - [`getting_started.Rmd`](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/blob/main/lecture01-intro/getting_started.Rmd) is the generating Rmarkdown file for `getting_started.md`
  - **[`first_script.R`](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/blob/main/lecture01-intro/first_script.R)** is a possible realization of the live coding session
  - [`assignment_1.R`](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats/blob/main/lecture01-intro/assignment_1.R) is the assignment after the first lecture.
